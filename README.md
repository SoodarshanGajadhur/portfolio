# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This project showcases the skills I acquired while learning web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The website is adapted from the [YouTube tutorial by JavaScript Mastery](https://youtu.be/0fYi8SGA20k?si=HwYK6hn7buo5l2Hv) and features engaging 3D animations using Three.js. It is hosted on Netlify for easy access.

## Project Overview

This portfolio website serves as a personal showcase of my web development projects and skills. It includes sections for an introduction, my work experience, project highlights, some tech I have worked with and contact information. The design and functionality were inspired by the tutorial but have been customized to reflect my personal style and preferences.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive 3D Animations**: Utilizes Three.js to provide visually appealing and interactive 3D elements.
- **Dynamic React Components**: Interactive components built with React to enhance user engagement.
- **Project Showcase**: Displays a selection of projects with descriptions and links.
- **Contact Form**: A simple form with 3D animations for visitors to get in touch with me.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building dynamic user interfaces and managing state.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and functionality to the website.
- **Three.js**: For creating and managing 3D graphics and animations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design.
- **Vite**: For a fast build tool and development server.
- **NodeJS**: For server-side JavaScript execution and development tooling.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application to ensure consistent development and production environments.
- **DOM (Document Object Model)**: For manipulating the web page structure dynamically.
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: For handling data interchange and configuration.
